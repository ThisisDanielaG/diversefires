                 <h2>Assessment</h2>
                 <div>Employing applied anthropological methodologies, this assessment investigates a universityâ€™s organizational culture to provide insights crucial for designing academic resources and developing impactful strategies to increase student academic success and a sense of belonging on campus. The importance of how a sense of belonging significantly influences student engagement, community building, and overall student success is illustrated by data gathered with qualitative methods. This project provides actionable recommendations for increasing student success and creating environments informed by students' current needs and wants.

                 <h2>Ceramics</h2>
                 <div> Daniela began her ceramics journey during 2020 pandemic. This coincided with her undergraduate studies, where she found solace and inspiration in her first handbuilding course. As she transitioned into graduate school, her passion for ceramics deepened, leading her to learn the art of wheel throwing.
        While Daniela solidified her commitment to understanding, supporting, and building communities she also discovered a profound connection between her love for ceramics. The wedging table and wheel became not just tools for crafting clay but symbolic spaces where patience and commitment translated into beautiful forms.
        Daniela has established her home studio. Daniela is on a mission to define her unique artistic style through clay forms. She aims to share a narrative of clay and community, where each piece tells a story of patience, commitment, and the beauty that emerges when diverse elements come together.
