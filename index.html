<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Daniela is completing her thesis in the Anthropology Department at the California State University of Long Beach. She is presenting at the Annual Conference for the Society for Applied Anthropology this March 2024. 
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
Her study explores a university's organizational culture through ethnographic interviews to inform the design of academic resources and strategies to increase a sense of belonging on a campus. Preliminary findings identify opportunities for growth in academic resources, despite the university's stated efforts and emphasis on belonging and community. Both students and staff leverage academic resources for building relationships, with negative impressions shaping student resource-seeking behaviors. Using anthropological methods, her study aims to provide actionable recommendations aligned with current student needs, emphasizing the pivotal role of belonging in DEI initiatives. This research underscores the practical application of anthropological insights in organizational strategies to foster student success.

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Daniela began her ceramics journey during 2020 pandemic. This coincided with her undergraduate studies, where she found solace and inspiration in her first handbuilding course. As she transitioned into graduate school, her passion for ceramics deepened, leading her to learn the art of wheel throwing.
While Daniela solidified her commitment to understanding, supporting, and building communities she also discovered a profound connection between her love for ceramics. The wedging table and wheel became not just tools for crafting clay but symbolic spaces where patience and commitment translated into beautiful forms.
Daniela has established her home studio. Daniela is on a mission to define her unique artistic style through clay forms. Her pottery pieces will be showcased on instagram @diversefires.
