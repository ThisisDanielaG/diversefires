### Meet Daniela Gonzalez

Daniela, a local of LA and Orange County, began her ceramics journey during 2020 pandemic. This coincided with her undergraduate studies, where she found solace and inspiration in her first handbuilding course. As she transitioned into graduate school, her passion for ceramics deepened, leading her to learn the art of wheel throwing.

Throughout her academic pursuits, Daniela discovered a profound connection between her love for ceramics and her commitment to understanding, supporting, and building communities. The wedging table and wheel became not just tools for crafting clay but symbolic spaces where patience and commitment translated into beautiful forms.

In her academic and professional life, Daniela has passionately focused on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Her commitment to creating inclusive spaces and fostering diverse communities mirrors the principles she embraces in her ceramic endeavors. The same dedication that molds clay on the wheel informs her approach to building harmonious and collaborative environments within organizations. She is currently writing her master's thesis to complete her master's from California State University of Long Beach.

Daniela has established her home studio. Daniela is on a mission to define her unique artistic style through clay forms. Her pottery pieces will be showcased on instagram @diversefires - reflecting not only her artistic expression but also the impact of her passion for DEI.

Follow her journey as Daniela embarks on her DEI career and ceramics small business, seamlessly blending her creative pursuits with her dedication to make effective change and close inequities. Her website will be a narrative of clay and community, where each piece tells a story of patience, commitment, and the beauty that emerges when diverse elements come together.
